# SemaFy — Understand Smart Contracts Before You Sign

A human-readable trust layer for smart contracts

## Overview

SemaFy converts smart contracts into clear, human-readable explanations. It helps users understand what a contract does, who controls it, and what risks they take, before interacting on-chain.

## The Problem

- **Users sign transactions they don't understand** — Leading to potential losses and exploitation
- **Smart contracts are unreadable to non-experts** — Technical barriers prevent informed decision-making
- **Audits are rare, expensive, and slow** — Most contracts never receive professional security review
- **AI-only explanations hallucinate and miss risks** — Pure AI approaches lack deterministic accuracy

## The Solution

SemaFy combines:

- **Static contract analysis** (deterministic, explainable)
- **AI explanation** (human-friendly, contextual)
- **Clear risk surfacing** (not fear-mongering)

## How It Works

1. Fetches contract source + ABI
2. Detects known risk patterns
3. Summarizes permissions & controls
4. Uses AI to explain results in plain language

## What This Is NOT

❌ **Not a smart contract audit** — This tool provides insights, not comprehensive security reviews

❌ **Not a security guarantee** — Always do your own research and exercise caution

❌ **Not financial advice** — Make informed decisions based on multiple sources

*This honesty builds trust.*

## Open Source Philosophy

- **Core logic is open for transparency** — Verify how analysis works
- **Designed for self-hosting and learning** — Run it yourself, understand the code
- **Built portfolio-first, startup-shaped** — Real-world utility with growth potential

## Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-chain support
- [ ] Wallet integrations
- [ ] Hosted API
- [ ] Community risk rules

## License

**MPL 2.0** (Mozilla Public License 2.0)

MPL was chosen to balance transparency and practicality: the core logic remains open and auditable, while allowing the project to be used, extended, and integrated into commercial systems. This supports trust, collaboration, and long-term sustainability.
